# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The aim of this project is to train a deep learning model that would help a car drive autonomously around the track

Overview
---
This repository contains 3 main files which will help for the review of the Behavioral Cloning Project.

* model.py: 
* drive.py: The script used to drive the car autonomously
* model.h5: The already trained and saved keras model
* video.mp: A recording of the autonomous driving.

The Project
---
We were given tools and a dataset that would help to get through this project from one end to another these tools are described below
* The simulator is used to drive the car and collect data 
* Otherwise a large dataset of almost 8000 images is provided by udacity.
* Some data collection techniques are given to us to help go through the project

## Details About the Project

Great details about the project can be found in the writeup.md submitted to udacity.

## Credits

I have to award great credit to this [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@fromtheast/you-dont-need-lots-of-data-udacity-behavioral-cloning-6d2d87316c52), because after spending more than 30 hours trying to tune the dataset by driving the car, I feel on this good technique to save time.
